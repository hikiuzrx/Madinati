                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our journey began at the prestigious "Boumerdes Smart City" Hackathon 2024,
                    where a personal challenge became our mission. While attempting to reach the
                    event venue, we faced the common struggles of public transport navigation:
                    unreliable schedules, unclear routes, and outdated information. Existing
                    solutions like Google Maps fell short in our local context, inspiring us to
                    create a solution tailored for Algeria's unique urban landscape. We envisioned a
                    platform that would enable the user to go from point A to point B without the
                    stress of planning, asking for directions, or waiting for the next bus. The
                    application had to provide real-time updates, personalized routes based on user
                    preferences, and a seamless experience for both locals and tourists.

                    At the heart of Madinati lies a sophisticated pathfinding system, powered by our
                    custom version of the Dijkstra algorithm. This system processes comprehensive
                    data from Algiers' integrated transport network, including buses, metro lines,
                    trams, and telepheriques. Our solution adapts to real-time conditions, ensuring
                    you always have the most efficient route at your fingertips.
