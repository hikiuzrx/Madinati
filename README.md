# Madinati Route Finder Demo

## Welcome to The Madinati Route Finder Demo

### An application üì≤ developed to address a real-world problem üåç by [Team Hartaka](#team) üó£Ô∏è

Madinati transforms the way you navigate Algerian cities through an intelligent urban transport platform. By seamlessly integrating various public transport options, we make city exploration and daily commuting effortless and efficient. Whether you're a tourist discovering Algeria's rich cultural heritage or a local planning your daily route, our platform ensures a smooth journey through the urban landscape.

### The Spark Behind Madinati üß≠

Our journey began at the prestigious "Boumerdes Smart City" Hackathon 2024, where a personal challenge became our mission. While attempting to reach the event venue, we faced the common struggles of public transport navigation: unreliable schedules, unclear routes, and outdated information. Existing solutions like Google Maps fell short in our local context, inspiring us to create a solution tailored for Algeria's unique urban landscape. We envisioned a platform that would enable the user to go from point A to point B without the stress of planning, asking for directions, or waiting for the next bus. The application had to provide real-time updates, personalized routes based on user preferences, and a seamless experience for both locals and tourists.

### Technical Innovation üß†

At the heart of Madinati lies a sophisticated pathfinding system, powered by our custom version of the Dijkstra algorithm. This system processes comprehensive data from Algiers' integrated transport network, including buses, metro lines, trams, and telepheriques. Our solution adapts to real-time conditions, ensuring you always have the most efficient route at your fingertips.

Through dynamic route calculations and crowdsourced traffic updates, Madinati offers personalized journey options that consider your preferences and current conditions. Whether you're a daily commuter or a tourist exploring the city's treasures, Madinati stands as your reliable urban navigation companion, making every journey smoother and more predictable.
